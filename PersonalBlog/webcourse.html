            <h3>Week 1</h3>
            <p>We learned introduction about the HTML
                and Web that was published on
                <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">www.w3schools.com</a>
                and created our first webpage with tables that was fun to implement.
                <br>
                This was created during this lab session:
                <a href="WebLab1.html" target="_blank">Lab1</a>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row-second">
            <img src="images/W3Schools.png" alt="" class="small-img">
        </div>
        <div class="row-second">
            <h3>Week 2</h3>
            <p>We learned about the tags and attribute of basic HTML
                and implemented a webpage with images and special characters
                that are not easy to put in a paragraph
                <br>
                This was created during this lab session:
                <a href="WebLab2.html" target="_blank">Lab2</a>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <img src="images/html5.jpg" alt="" class="small-img">
        </div>

        <div class="row-second">
            <h3>Week 3</h3>
            <p>HTML forms and styling were introduced and implemented with some styles
                using css3 styling methods that was new to us and was amazing though it was difficult.
                <br>
                This web page was created during this lab session:
                <a href="WebLab3.html" target="_blank">Lab3</a>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <img src="images/html5-css3.png" alt="" class="small-img">
        </div>
        <div class="row-second">
            <h3>Week 4</h3>
            <p>Our first version of the personal blog was created.
                A very basic and simple webpage that contains images.
                But this time we used DIVs to divide the page for each category.
                Our first version of the blog had an html form in it which was unnecessary.
                <br>
                This was the webpage I created:
                <a href="WebLab4.html">Lab4</a>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <img src="images/divs.png" alt="" class="small-img">
        </div>
        <div class="row-second">
            <h3>Week 5</h3>
            <p>A webpage was created that included images and written text on it,
                and our first styled anchor was created and it was stunning to see
                how styling can affect the page in a few lines of code.
                The anchor scrolls down the page to a div that was connected to it
                through the id
                <br>
                This is the result of the fifth lab session:
                <a href="WebLab5.html">Lab5</a>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <img src="images/labScreenshot.png" alt="" class="small-img">
        </div>
